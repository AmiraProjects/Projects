                        <p>The Jungle Adventure is a platformer game made using Construct3.
                            It's about a boy who was sent by his teacher to save endangered plants
                            and puts them in the botanical garden. There are 3 plants to save.
                            In the middle of a jungle where he must save the plants, there are so many
                            obstacle he must pass. Such as poisonous water/river which is dangerous to drink or fallen in, 
                            fragile rocks that makes cliffs harder to climb. All these thing happens because of illegal
                            activities done by humans in the forest.

                        <h3>Feeding Fish</h3>
                        <p>Feeding Fish is an endless game made with Construct3. In this game, players
                            must feed the fish with small fishes deep under the ocean just like
                            the game title. However, there is so many trashes which was thrown in the sea,
                            sinks near the hungry fish area. That makes it so much harder to eat small fishes
                            as many of them swim away. Other than that, the longer you play, the more 
                            dangerous sea creatures that came like octopuses, sharks, jellyfish.
                            Those creatures also wants food because their area was full of trashes.
